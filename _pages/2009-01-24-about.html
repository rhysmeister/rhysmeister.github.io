<p><a title="Rhys Campbell's SQL Server Blog" href="http://www.youdidwhatwithtsql.com" target="_self">http://www.youdidwhatwithtsql.com</a> is the personal blog of Rhys Campbell. I'm a DBA with a diverse range of experience with SQL Server, Sybase, MySQL, MariaDB, MongoDB and PostgreSQL. I'm a dab hand at solving problems with scripting, be it with Bash, Powershell or Python. I enjoy tackling the dodgy database query that nobody can seem to speed up. I used to be a Windows guy but seem to have slowly become a Linux guy over the years. No bad thing!</p>
<p>I currently reside in the beautiful medieval city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bern" target="_blank">Bern</a> in Switzerland and wish I had time for skiing and Dog ownership. I like to spend my spare time building things with computers, running, gyming, avoiding chocolate and getting less fat.</p>
<p>P.S. My German stinks, my Schweizerdeutsch even more so. Check back in 2 years. Tsch√ºss.</p>
