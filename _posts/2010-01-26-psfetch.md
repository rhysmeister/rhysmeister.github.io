I really used to like [apt-get](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Packaging_Tool) when I used to run [Linux](http://www.linux.org/) as my home os a few years ago. Once you got the hang of it installing and managing software was easy. I'm obviously pleased to see [PsFetch](http://www.psfetch.net/) in development. This tool is the Windows [Powershell](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/management/powershell/default.mspx) take on apt-get which will allow you to get your hand on cmdlets, scripts, and by the looks of it, tools from [codeplex](http://www.codeplex.com). They're currently building up a [repository](http://www.psfetch.net/browse/) with lots of cool scripts.
