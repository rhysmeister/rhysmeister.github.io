Here's a quick [Powershell](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-gb/scriptcenter/powershell.aspx "Windows Powershell") script I knocked up to help me check AD Group Memberships between two user accounts. Just set the&nbsp; **$user1&nbsp;** and&nbsp; **$user2&nbsp;** variables and you're good to go.

```
Import-Module ActiveDirectory;

$user1 = "username1";
$user2 = "username2";

$groups1 = Get-ADPrincipalGroupMembership –Identity $user1 | Select-Object -Property Name;
$groups2 = Get-ADPrincipalGroupMembership –Identity $user2 | Select-Object -Property Name;

if($groups1.Count -ne $groups2.Count)
{
	Write-Host "The two accounts contain a different number of groups.";
}

foreach($group in $groups1)
{
	echo "1 $group";
	if($groups2 -match $group)
	{
		Write-Host "$user1 & $users2 are both members of $group.";
	}
	else
	{
		Write-host "$user2 is not a member of $group";
	}
}

# Reverse check
foreach($group in $groups2)
{
	if($groups1 -match $group)
	{
		# No need to reoutput message;
	}
	else
	{
		Write-host "$user1 is not a member of $group";
	}
}
```

Output will resemble below;

```
The two accounts contain a different number of groups.
username1 & are both members of @{Name=Domain Users}.
username2 is not a member of @{Name=AD Group One}
username1 & are both members of @{Name=VPN Group}.
username2 is not a member of @{Name=Development AD Group}
username2 is not a member of @{Name=SQL Admins Group}
username2 is not a member of @{Name=AD Group Four}
```
