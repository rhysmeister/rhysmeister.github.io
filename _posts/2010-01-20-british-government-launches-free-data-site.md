Just a quick post about the British Governments launch of [data.gov.uk](http://data.gov.uk) offering free access to a large number of datasets. It's good to see this data, that we as taxpayers have funded, available for free use. Hats off to [The Guardian's](http://www.guardian.co.uk) long running [free our data](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/free-our-data) campaign.

The site is being officially launched by [Sir Tim Berners Lee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee) tomorrow, but you can access [the site](http://data.gov.uk) now. The US has their own version [data.gov](http://data.gov) but the British site boasts nearly three times as many datasets. Take a peek at the [available datasets](http://data.gov.uk/data/all). It always fantastic looking through the great number of [apps](http://data.gov.uk/apps) that people create around freely available data. Why not take a look and start your own project?

Those interested in London specific data can check out the [London DataStore.](http://data.london.gov.uk/) People in sunny San Francisco have [datasf](http://datasf.org/) and Chicago also have a [dataset section](http://egov.cityofchicago.org/CityData/CityData.html) on their website. Read [more about this](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/jan/20/tim-berners-lee-free-data).
