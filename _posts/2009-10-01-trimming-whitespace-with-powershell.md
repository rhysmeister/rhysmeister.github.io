A few days ago I was working with a client that was providing an export of data from [Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/index.html). The file being produced was choking my [SSIS](http://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2005/en/us/integration-services.aspx) package due to various formatting issues. After working with the client and getting a file that looked good to the naked eye I discovered that a large amount of whitespace on the end of each line was making things break at my end.

I need to import this file quickly so I decided to fix it myself. As usual [Powershell](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/management/powershell/default.mspx) was up to the task! Hereâ€™s the script I came up with. This script will process a file called **test.csv** located in e:\ and produce a new file called **test2.csv** with the trailing whitespace removed from each line.

```
$content = "";
$file = "e:\test.csv";
$count = 0;
Write-Progress -Activity "Processing file" -CurrentOperation "Line = 0" -PercentComplete 0 -Status "Starting" -Id 1;
$lines = Get-Content -Path $file;
$percent_complete = 0;

# trim line by line
foreach($line in $lines)
{
 	$line = $line.TrimEnd();
 	$content += "$line`n" # Add a newline
 	$count++;
 	$percent_complete = [int][Math]::Ceiling((($count / $lines.Count) * 100));
	 Write-Progress -Activity "Processing file" -CurrentOperation "Line = $count" -PercentComplete $percent_complete -Status "Running" -Id 1;
}

$content | Set-Content -Path "e:\test2.csv";
Write-Progress -Activity "Finished processing file" -CurrentOperation "All lines processed" -PercentComplete 100 -Status "Complete" -Id 1;
Sleep(5);
```

After this quick fix the file was easily imported!
