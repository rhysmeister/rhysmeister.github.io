I was getting the following error when attempting to run **hadoop version.**

```
The java class is not found: org.apache.hadoop.util.VersionInfo
Unable to determine Hadoop version information.
'hadoop version' returned:
The java class is not found: org.apache.hadoop.util.VersionInfo
```

This was due to having the [OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net/) installed rather than the one from Sun/Oracle. To resolve this simply uninstall the openjdk packages...

```
sudo zypper remove java
```

Download one of the [Sun/Oracle java packages](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) for your platform. I installed it with...

```
sudo rpm -iv jdk-7u11-linux-x64.rpm
```

I also had to set my java home to **/usr**. Remember to set this is your .profile or somewhere else appropriate. Now when I run **hadoop version** I get...

```
Hadoop 2.0.2-alpha

Happy Hadoop'ing!
