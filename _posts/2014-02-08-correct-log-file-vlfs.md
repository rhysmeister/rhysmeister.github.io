The what and why of this post is explained here [Transaction Log VLFs â€“ too many or too few?](http://www.sqlskills.com/blogs/kimberly/transaction-log-vlfs-too-many-or-too-few/ "SQL Server Virtual Log Files"). Presented here is a quick practical example of how you might correct this issue in a database log file.

As a first step you'll need to get the logical name of your log file for the database in question.

```
USE your_database;

SELECT *
FROM sys.database_files;
GO
```

You'll want to make sure there is no activity in the database so it doesn't interfere with our efforts. Note this does kick everyone out of the database.

```
ALTER DATABASE your_database SET RESTRICTED_USER WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE;
```

Next shrink your log file;

```
DBCC SHRINKFILE(log_name, 0, TRUNCATEONLY);
```

Now we can resize the log. Here I am growing the log in 8GB increments (ok, slightly over) so we end up with VLFs 512MB in size.

```
USE master
GO

ALTER DATABASE your_database
MODIFY FILE
(
	NAME = log_name,
	SIZE = 8200MB
);
GO

ALTER DATABASE your_database
MODIFY FILE
(
	NAME = log_name,
	SIZE = 16400MB
);
GO

ALTER DATABASE your_database
MODIFY FILE
(
	NAME = log_name,
	SIZE = 24600MB
);
GO

ALTER DATABASE your_database
MODIFY FILE
(
	NAME = log_name,
	SIZE = 32800MB
);
GO
```

Now set the database back to multi user.

```
ALTER DATABASE your_database SET MULTI_USER;
```

Inspect your log VLF structure.

```
DBCC LOGINFO;
```
