<p>Just a quick <a title="Windows Powershell" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_PowerShell" target="_blank">Powershell</a> snippet that I'm going to use to run validation tests on one of my staging Failover Clusters during OOH.</p>
<p>The script below will take some services offline, run the validation tests, before bringing the appropriate cluster groups back online. The report will be saved using the date as the name. To use this you will need to set <strong>$cluster</strong>Â appropriately and perhaps customize the cluster groups that are brought offline &amp; online.</p>
<pre lang="Powershell">Import-Module FailoverClusters;

# Set cluster name
$cluster = "Cluster";

# Date stamp used for report name
$date = Get-Date -Format "yyyyMMdd";

# Take cluster services offline. You may need to customise this
# according to your specific needs
Stop-ClusterGroup -Cluster $cluster -Name "ClusterDtc";
Stop-ClusterGroup -Cluster $cluster -Name "SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER)";

# Test Cluster
Test-Cluster -Cluster $cluster -ReportName "$date";

# Bring services back online
Start-ClusterGroup -Cluster $cluster -Name "ClusterDtc";
Start-ClusterGroup -Cluster $cluster -Name "SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER)";</pre>
<p>The output will look something like below...</p>
<pre>Name                       OwnerNode                                      State
