Things have been rather quiet on this blog lately as I've just been finalizing the details for my new role as a [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) DBA \ Developer. This may seem a little odd, considering [TSQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transact-SQL) is mentioned in my blog url, but I frequently [blog about MySQL](http://www.youdidwhatwithtsql.com/category/mysql) and have worked with it previously in a professional environment. I'll still be working with SQL Server but MySQL will be the primary database platform I'll be working with.

To be honest I'm excited to get the chance to get a handle on [MySQL replication](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/replication.html) as well as working on [integration between MySQL and SQL Server](http://www.youdidwhatwithtsql.com/executing-mysql-stored-procedures-from-sql-server/170). While you can certainly expect more MySQL content on this blog in the future I will still be posting stuff about SQL Server, SSIS, Powershell and associated technologies. So far a great start to 2010 for me!
