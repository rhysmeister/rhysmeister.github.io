Today I spotted a suspicious looking file called **login.txt** on the c drive of a customers web server. Being the ~~nosey~~ curious type I opened the file and this is what it contained...

```
Welcome!!!

This server is hacked by This_is_Joepie.
Download with fun and:
DON'T PUBLISH THIS IP ANYWHERE
DON'T REHACK THIS SERVER
DON'T SCAN THIS IP RANGE

Thnx!!!

```

I googled [This\_is\_Joepie](http://www.google.com/search?q=This_is_Joepie&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t) and, assuming they're the same person, this seems to be a gaming enthusiast from Holland. I went back to the c drive and ordered the files by last modified date revealing several more interesting files. The most interesting was **Servudaemon.ini**

```

Now I guess this person was running some kind of Warez ftp server. I couldn't locate any services running on the ports mentioned above or any dodgy looking files on the server. Do hackers clean up after themselves? The worrying thing is the the last modified date on these files was back at the start of 2002!
