I'm a little late blogging about this but I have these goals in my mind for this year.

- Get more organised. I have days where I'm super productive, and others where I feel like a dog chasing his own tail. I've seen a few people recommend [Getting things done](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-free-Productivity/dp/0749922648) by [David Allen](http://www.davidco.com/). So I've bought a copy to help me on my way.

- Lose another 10lbs. This will get me back to the weight I was when I was 21. I've no desire to end up like this guy.

- Run another half-marathon. I did the [Wycombe Half Marathon](http://www.runningdiary.co.uk/go/view.cgi/3002) a few years ago and I'd like to do another one before I attempt the full marathon. 
- Learn to speed read. I've started reading a book by [Tony Buzan](http://www.buzanworld.com/) about this. But yes, I'm struggling to find the time to pick it up!
- Become expert-level at [Powershell](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/management/powershell/default.mspx). I started learning PS this year and I love it. I'd like to continue to improve my skills in this area. 
- Become proficient at [SSAS](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms175609(SQL.90).aspx). I know virtually nothing about this so I'd like to add it to my [SQL Server](http://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2008/en/us/default.aspx) skill set. 
- Learn a new programming language. A few friends have tried to turn me on to [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/). As cool as I think it is the syntax really isn't my thing. I'm considering Google's [Go](http://golang.org/) but I'm open to suggestions.
- Blog regularly. I don't think I did too bad last year in terms of blogging frequency but I'd like it to be higher this year. 
- Build up my savings again. My move into awesome [Clerkenwell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clerkenwell) last year wiped out most of my savings. I'd like to build this back up again. It's always sensible having a little nest egg.

- See more of London. I've lived in central London for several years but haven't taken advantage of it like I should have. This year I will visit more museums, attend more events and concerts, and enjoy the best city in the world a whole lot more.
- Take a holiday. I didn't manage a proper holiday in 2009. Thinking of visiting Tokyo and New York this year.
- Finish a project a two. I've got a couple of projects up my sleeve I'd like to complete this year. One more serious than [Tweet-SQL](http://www.tweet-sql.com) and another just as fun!
